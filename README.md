### Introduction
This is a mini project to demonstrate my ability to use PyTorch to build CNN models and understanding on the workflow of training a model in PyTorch. The model reached a testing accuracy of 90.70% (without data augmentation on the training dataset).

More performance details about the model can be seen in the ipynb file.
